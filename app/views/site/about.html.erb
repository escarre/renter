			The purpose of Renter is to document the condition of your apartment at the start of a lease-period and have a verifiable way for your landlord to acknowledge its condition as well. It's simple and practical. It's not a sexy idea. It's the kind of practical advice that overprotective fathers tell their daughters before they move in to their first apartment. Which is exactly where the idea is from. Except, in my case, my father told me that I should print the photos and then mail them to my landlord via certified mail. Good advice, but it's 2014, and if there's one thing I dislike doing, it's going to the post office. Surely, there could be a better way. <br>Thus, Renter was born.

        <h2>Upload photos.</h2>
        <p>After creating an account, start by uploading photos of your empty apartment. Be sure to photograph any areas that have pre-existing damage or visible wear, such as holes from hanging things on the wall, splotches in the paint, or large scuffs in the floor. Take as many photos as you need to adequately document the apartment.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4 about">
				<%= image_tag "email-icon.png" %>
        <h2>Share with landlord.</h2>
        <p>Once you have uploaded all your photos, click "Share with Landlord." An email will be sent to your landlord a containing link to the gallery of photos and a randomly generated 16 digit verification code. Your landlord will be able to go through the photos and then confirm and approve the images by entering his 16-digit verification code.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-4 about">
				<%= image_tag "apt_icon.png" %>
        <h2>That's all!</h2>
        <p>Now your apartment has been documented and mutually confirmed! After the code as been submitted, the gallery will show the date and time that it was confirmed. Photos will still be visible, but can no longer be edited. When it's time for you to move on, reference back to the gallery of your images.</p>
