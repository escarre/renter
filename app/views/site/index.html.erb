          <h2>Super Fast</h2>
          <p>1. Upload the photos of your apartment. 2. Share them with your landlord. All you need is your landlord's name and email address. Your landlord follows the link and inputs the code (both are in the email). Quick and painless for everyone.</p>

          <h2>Practical</h2>
          <p>Renter lets both you and your landlord know exactly how your apartment looked upon move-in. Mutual agreement of the condition of your rental at the start of your lease helps protect you against being blamed for pre-existing damage.</p>

          <h2>Hip & Fun</h2>
          <p>Just kidding. Under Renter's colorful exterior, it's not a sexy idea. It is smart and practical, like wearing sensible shoes when you're walking around or having one of those silvery blankets in your trunk, just in case. </p>
